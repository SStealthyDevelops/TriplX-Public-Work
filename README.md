# Public Java/Spigot Work

### What is this?
This is a collection of work I made between 2018 and 2021 toward a standalone mini-game network ("TriplX"). A large portion of the work that was completed is displayed here. 100% of the code is written by me (well, maybe 1-3% is StackOverflow and Google...) This project was dropped by me in 2022, as I had to focus on my academics. I have decided to open-source this work as a demonstration of my capabilities and as a resource for those interested in Minecraft development.

### Important Notes
Though a lot of the programs enclosed in this repository are complete and functional, some of the work is incomplete. Examples include the Sky-Domination mini-game plugin and the Hubcore lobby management plugin. I was fairly inexperienced in the professional development world when writing a lot of these programs (they were for my own project, after all), hence, you might notice certain semantics not being followed properly. I have, of course, since learned herein mentioned semantics and coding practices. The quality of my programming has improved, as I have undertaken a more dynamic range of projects that have improved my understanding of software engineering and system design.
